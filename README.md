# CS425Proj2
Python Flask database-backed web app for a school library.
- Current most updated branch: https://github.com/JaviSorribes/CS425Proj2

## Requirements:
- Python 3.4 or later
- Python modules: flask, flask-mysql
- MySQL 5.6 or later (use 'root' as username, and 'pass' as password)

## Set up Database:
Use MySQL Server with username "root" and password "pass". Let the host be "localhost" and the port "3306". All these set up items are specfied at the beginning of app.py and can be modified if required.

Then, create a connection and run DB/build/genesis.sql to create the database and tables and DB/build/procreate.sql to populate them (only once).

## Run:
Run app.py and go to the url given.

## Note/Disclaimer:
This project was created from a previous one to have a basis for the Flask app. However, most of the original was deleted and the project was started almost from scratch.
